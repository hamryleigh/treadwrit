Title: VHS PIZZA  
Multi-cam Stage Comedy - Sans Laugh Track  

INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING  

The screech of an ALARM BLARING at **6AM**. A hand slaps the clock, silencing it impatiently. TOM, early 30s, scruffy, disheveled, and unironically clad in sleep-deprived exhaustion, groans beneath a mangled blanket.   

VHS tapes lay scattered around the room—evidence of nostalgia and binge sessions gone too deep. An old pepperoni pizza box sits on the corner of a crowded desk; it’s become part of the decor now.  

Tom sits up, rubs his face, then stares at the room in a haze as if to say "Fuck it, let's roll."

INT. VHS PIZZA - EARLY MORNING  

A synthwave banger hums over the opening montage. The pizzaria flickers to life like an indie film intro—the kitchen is dimly lit, but the space hums with potential. Flour dust lingers in the air. VHS tapes are lovingly stacked, every corner cramped with nostalgic chaos.  

**V.O. (TOM)**  
It’s a team effort. Everything about this ridiculous little kingdom runs smoother than it should. Champions of dough, grease, and cinema. Sometimes they even work. Sometimes.  

**V.O. (TOM, CONT'D)**  
Nina Russo. Frontline. Dough doesn’t knead itself. She doesn’t let it.  

**FREEZE FRAME: NINA RUSSO**  
NINA, late 20s, leans over a mound of dough, arms flexing like she trained for this. A cigarette dangles crooked from her lips, forgotten as she glances at her phone once mid-knead.  

**NINA**  
Anybody who says carbs are bad can personally go fuck themselves.  

**V.O. (TOM)**  
Jimmy Martinez. Delivery driver. Loving pain in my ass. Everyone calls him Screwball. Some names just stick.  

**FREEZE FRAME: JIMMY "SCREWBALL" MARTINEZ**  
JIMMY bursts into the frame juggling a VHS tape and a pizza box like chaos in human form. His shirt, scuffed and chaotic, reads: *"Scott Pilgrim Was Right."*  

**JIMMY**  
Yo! Best Norman Bates? Vince Vaughn. Don’t @ me!  

**V.O. (TOM)**  
Becky Nguyen. Counterfront. She’s got the sass of an indie film and the work ethic of someone who knows they could do better.  

**FREEZE FRAME: BECKY NGUYEN**  
BECKY stands near the sauce station, eating someone else’s unfinished slice mid-stretch. Deadpan sarcasm etched across her face.  

**BECKY**  
If food isn’t a full-body experience, you’re doing it wrong.  


**V.O. (TOM)**  
Then there’s Tony Wallace. Handles the hardware. Tapes, machines, all the analog shit most people forgot exists.  

**FREEZE FRAME: TONY WALLACE**  
TONY exhales smoke so slow it might be time-lapse footage, crouched low and holding a rewinder in one hand like it’s delicate treasure.  

**TONY**  
If this place burns to the ground, I’m saving the rewinder. That’s it.  

**V.O. (TOM)**  
And then there’s me. Trying, every single day, to slow the tsunami of absolute chaos barreling toward the nicest pizza/VHS rental/nostalgia hole in town.  

The music builds—a crescendo of clanging pizza trays and the hiss of sauce bubbling. The scene crackles with purpose, lives layering into the space. This is a well-oiled, frenetic machine. The champions of VHS Pizza hard at work.  

And then...  

CUT TO:  

INT. VHS PIZZA - KITCHEN - SAME TIME  

The narration STOPS. The music screeches to silence.  

Nobody is doing anything.  

Nina leans into her phone, scrolling TikTok one-handed while lazily smacking dough like a bored toddler with Play-Doh. Jimmy sits leaned back in a chair, chewing at the crust of yesterday’s cold pizza. Becky lounges at a booth seat, sipping soda out of a plastic cup she didn’t pay for. Tony sits slumped at the VHS repair counter, phone in one hand, cigarette in the other, radiating “I peaked in ’97” energy.  

In one corner, a lone customer—a shady-looking guy with grease patches on his jean jacket named BILL—glares intently at the side shelf labeled, *"DO NOT TOUCH: ADULT ONLY TITLES."* Next to him, a soccer kid in uniform devours their garlic knots like it’s game day and dinner might never come again.  

From above, *Tom* descends the wooden staircase from his upstairs apartment with all the preparation of a tired Roman emperor returning to manage arena-level bullshit. He stops. He watches. He sighs.  

**TOM**  
*(in disbelief)*  
Oh, what the fuck.  

**JIMMY**  
*(still chewing, not even glancing over)*  
Yo, boss—you see this morning’s sunrise? Life vibes. Real deep metaphor material.  

Nina side-eyes him, does not look impressed.  

**NINA**  
Shut up, Screwball. You’ve got, like, old cheese stuck to your ass.  

Jimmy checks briefly, grins like it’s a badge of honor rather than proof he doesn’t do laundry.  

Becky slouches further with all the professional energy of a hungover intern.  

**BECKY**  
You need me to put in effort or something? Because that probably isn’t happening.  

Tony blows a plume of smoke, squinting toward Tom like he’s staring down an HR meeting he already hates.  

**TONY**  
I’d get up, but I don't care enough to fake it today.  

The chaos is a storm quietly brewing in the background of Tom’s life. He doesn’t need anyone to perform—not yet—just to *stop actively testing his patience.*  

*Cue the day beginning... eventually.*  

Tom freezes, and his worst suspicion is confirmed: no one’s doing jack shit. Nina doesn’t even look up from her phone.  

**NINA**  
You’re mad at Tony for smoking, but *that guy’s* been doing crimes against pizza for fifteen minutes straight.  

Jimmy attempts yet another pizza flip. It sticks to his face briefly before falling.  

**TOM**  
How many times do I have to tell you? You don’t call me boss. It’s *Tom.* Just Tom.  

Tony flicks long ash from a very real cigarette, giving the slowest look up like God himself just inconvenienced him.  

**TONY**  
Sure thing, *Tom.* But the second I call you that in front of a customer who’s holding a ten-year-old Blockbuster coupon, don’t come crying to me.  

Nina snorts, kneading dough half-heartedly.  

**NINA**  
Tom, huh? Alright, Just Tom. Want me to stencil that on the bathroom walls? *‘Call me Just Tom: Also Wash Your Damn Hands.’*  

Becky practically collapses in her booth laughing.  

**BECKY**  
Oh, yeah, let’s get that inspirational wall art printed. "Live, Laugh, Loser."  

Tom sighs. He looks down at Tony mid-cig drag.  

**TOM**  
How many times do I have to say it? No smoking inside.  

Tony lets out a loooong, reluctant exhale as if being forced to perform physical labor.  

**TONY**  
Buzzkill.  

Before anyone can riff, shady-ass Bill lights up from the far booth. The room freezes.  

**TOM**  
*(snapping immediately)*  
Bill. Man. Sorry but you gotta put that shit out.  

Bill leans back, exhaling a perfect smoke ring like he learned it from eight seasons of Mad Men reruns.  

**BILL**  
Seriously, Tom? Been comin’ here for *years.* Thought this was a chill spot.  

Soccer kid pipes up, little league hyper:  

**SOCCER KID**  
No smoking inside! My coach says cigs kill your lungs, dude!  

**BILL**  
Coach sounds like a narc.  

Tom looks around at the chaos. His eyes twitch. Bill stares.  

**TOM**  
Put it out or get out.  

Bill grumbles, snuffs it out like a pouting teen.  


INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - DAY  

Tom, jacket slung over one arm, steps toward the door. He hesitates, glancing over at the sheer *lack* of action in the room. Nina flops dough onto a counter like she’s punching it to death post-breakup. Jimmy holds a slice of cold pizza like it’s a microphone, rambling to himself about something only Jimmy cares about. Becky slouches, unfazed, cutting loose hunks of mozzarella straight into her mouth. Tony, still at the counter, pokes at a rewinder like he’s experimenting on it for science.  

Tom sighs. Deeply.  

**TOM**  
I’m stepping out to grab supplies. Be normal for, like… I dunno, an *hour.* Can you do that?  

Everyone looks up at him in unnervingly synchronized confusion, as if he just asked them to moonwalk across the ceiling.  

**NINA**  
Normal?

**BECKY**  
Like normal-normal?  

**TOM**  
*(deadpan)*  
Let me rephrase: Don’t weird out customers, start a fire, or drag the police here. That too much to ask?  

Jimmy raises a hand like he’s mid-classroom.  

**JIMMY**  
What if the cops are already here but, like, socially? Like a *chill cop vibe*—no handcuffs, just mozzarella bread.  

The bells CHIME as Tom walks out the door, muttering faintly on his way out.  

**TOM**  
I probably deserve this.  

The moment the door shuts, a weird calm settles across the room—a calm that instantly feels unnatural. Everyone slows, glances at each other, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  

**BECKY**  
We really gonna burn this bitch down?

**NINA**  
You’re kidding, right?  

**BECKY**  
Sure.  

Jimmy slides into the mix, leaning obnoxiously between the counter and the slicer like a gremlin ready to stir the pot.  

**JIMMY**  
Alright, calm before the storm. What dumb-ass topic are we yelling about today? Let’s make it spicy. No politics— we did that yesterday.  

**TONY**  
*(gruff, without looking up from the rewinder)*  
Yell quieter.  

**NINA**  
Fine. Hot take: Broadway adaptations are overrated garbage churned out by nepotism babies who can’t write.  

Jimmy freezes mid-chew. A piece of cold crust drops from his mouth in actual cartoon shock.  

**JIMMY**  
You're not serious...  

Nina shrugs. Completely unfazed; she knows what she just unleashed.  

**NINA**  
What? Restaging movies as musicals is just recycling at this point. Real musicals don't need to piggyback on old IP.  

Jimmy gasps loudly, clutching his chest, spilling imaginary tea.  

**JIMMY**  
Did you just disrespect *Sweeney Todd's* entire legacy to my FACE?! In this *HOUSE*?!  

**NINA**  
*(smirking)*  
Sweeney Todd did it right. The rest? Cheap knock-offs designed to suck money out of nostalgia freaks like you.  

Becky jumps in from the booth, now fully invested for the *potential violence.*  

**BECKY**  
Nina’s not wrong. Half the crap on Broadway now is just movie scripts funked-up with overproduced melodies.  

Jimmy storms toward her, hand pointing dramatically like some overly caffeinated theater professor about to destroy a student’s thesis.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh, REALLY, Becky?! How about you whip up a Tony-winning soundtrack for *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark* and say THAT to Bono’s face?!  

**BECKY**  
Spare me the *U2 defense*, Screwball. Bono doesn’t even like Bono.  

**JIMMY**  
*(horrified gasp)*  
TAKE THAT BACK.  

Nina leans further into the counter, wiping flour off her palms while the shouting devolves into pure theater-kid-against-reality-chaos.  

**NINA**  
Face it, Jimmy. Without the overhyped movie adapt crowd, Broadway would actually have to... I dunno… *innovate.*  

Jimmy full-on loses it, spinning toward Tony, HIS LAST HOPE.  

**JIMMY**  
Tony—Tony, PLEASE tell me you’re on my side here. Good Broadway adaptations exist. Like, movie-to-stage-to-greatness—isn’t that a thing?!  

Tony looks up exactly once, stares blankly at Jimmy, then goes back to lazily picking apart the VHS rewinder.  

**TONY**  
You ever hear me talk about theater before?  

The camera holds awkwardly on Jimmy’s face as the existential realization that he’s alone in this war lands squarely in his brain.  

**JIMMY**  
Fine. FINE. But don’t say that I didn’t warn all of you when *Fast & Furious: The Musical* wins fourteen Tonys three years from now!  

Becky, Nina, and Tony all collectively groan in harmony, the only thing they’ve done in sync all day.  

**BECKY**  
God, I hate you so *fucking* much.  

Chaos is in full bloom. Jimmy is pacing like a deranged theater professor trying to workshop *his* feelings into a Tony-winning play. Becky leans back at the booth, casually munching on leftover crust, while Nina wipes flour off her palms, as calm as a bomb waiting to go off.

Tony is still lurking by the VHS repair counter like he’s jury duty-personified, waiting for this shitstorm to pass.  

**JIMMY**  
You uncultured, dough-slinging FILISTINES are sleeping on *everything* Broadway stands for! The emotion! The nostalgia! The *craft.*  

**BECKY**  
*(cutting in, dry as hell)*  
"Craft" is spending $400 for nosebleed seats to watch a grown man *rap* about Paul Revere while his spit lands on the front row.  

Jimmy gasps, staggering back as if Becky physically struck him with her words. He nearly knocks over a rack of VHS tapes.  

**JIMMY**  
OH, YOU DID NOT JUST COME FOR *HAMILTON*!  

**BECKY**  
Hamilton’s fine, Screwball. I'm just saying—Broadway’s hit-to-miss ratio is one guitar solo away from being Nickelback.  

Nina snorts into her sleeve, *absolutely* on Becky’s side at this point.  

**NINA**  
Jimmy, you’re ranting about it like Broadway ever paid your rent. It’s a hobby, not a *syndrome.*  

**JIMMY**  
Don’t patronize me, Nina! You probably think *Cats* was better WITHOUT the buttholes!  

Becky wheezes so hard that Dr. Pepper spills from her nose.  

**BECKY**  
*Buttholes?*  

Jimmy stares at her for far too long in righteous, furious silence.  

**JIMMY**  
You heard me.  

Tony, who has retained exactly zero shits for this conversation, decides now is the time to interject like a rogue philosopher in the chaos.  

**TONY**  
Play-to-film adaptations are better.  

Everyone freezes, heads spinning toward him like he summoned a demon.  

**JIMMY**  
*(horrified)*  
What the HELL did you just say?  

Tony keeps calm, puffing his cigarette with visible boredom glistening off him like dew on a summer morning.  

**TONY**  
Play-to-film. You adapt it, cut out all the boring-ass monologues, film it, clean. Done. Better.  

Jimmy’s hands flap wildly, gesturing at Tony like he's trying to perform a fucking exorcism.  

**JIMMY**  
Cut out the monologues?! TONY, THE MONOLOGUES ARE THE *HEART AND SOUL!*  

**TONY**  
Monologues are where I get up to take a piss, kid. Search your heart. You know I’m right.  

Jimmy steps forward, now fully in Tony's face, their height difference making it both hilarious and tragic.  

**JIMMY**  
You can't just boil down *fucking Shakespeare* to explosions and one-liners, Wallace! You’re turning art into a… a VHS action flick with Steven Seagal throwing punches in tights!  

Tony blows smoke directly into Jimmy's space.  

**TONY**  
Honestly? Sounds better already.  

**NINA**  
*(from across the counter, talking around a bag of pretzels)*  
Okay but, to be fair, Shakespeare probably *would* have written for Steven Seagal if he’d been alive in the '90s. Real "tempest in a bar fight" vibes.  

**BECKY**  
*(fake-musing)*  
Ooooh, can’t wait for Michael Bay's "Romeo & Juliet."

Jimmy spins on both of them, now full-on unhinged.  

**JIMMY**  
Y’ALL THINK THIS IS A *JOKE?!*  

**BECKY**  
Kinda?  

As Jimmy sputters to regain control of the conversation, Tony casually flicks his cigarette toward the nearest ashtray and leans back like this situation has already taken more energy out of him than it ever deserved.  

**TONY**  
All I’m saying, Screwball, is I’ll take *Glengarry Glen Ross* as a movie over live staging and fake applause. Put that shit on a VHS and it’s FLAWLESS.  

**JIMMY**  
*(despairing)*  
*Glengarry Glen Ross*?! You think Baldwin’s “coffee is for closers” speech hits harder in a MOVIE? Than LIVE?!  

Tony doesn’t even blink.  

**TONY**  
Yeah. More cameras. Better cuts. I’ve got it memorized. Fuckin’ killer monologue.  

Jimmy collapses into a booth, cradling a pizza box dramatically like it’s his dignity.  

**JIMMY**  
You're all dead to me.  

Nina leans over the counter toward Tony like she’s now mildly amused.  

**NINA**  
Okay, what about bad adaptions? Like… *Les Misérables.* Movie version?  

**TONY**  
*(darkly)*  
Russell Crowe owed someone money. That’s the only explanation I got for that warcrime.  

Becky snorts into her soda again.  

Jimmy’s still dramatically cradling a pizza box, muttering incoherent theater kid grievances to himself. Nina and Becky sit back, tag-teaming his Broadway-warped logic into submission while Tony sits at the edge of chaos like some kind of burnt-out philosopher.

Tom’s still missing, but the energy? It’s already halfway to a full-on theater nerd bloodbath.  

**JIMMY**  
*(clutching the metaphorical pearls of his soul)*  
Monologues carry the emotional weight of a performance. And y’all would just CUT THEM?! On FILM?!  

**BECKY**  
We’re saying most of them could stand to lose twenty percent of the whining.  

Nina folds her arms, smirking.  

**NINA**  
Or forty. Depends...  

Jimmy looks like his entire lineage is at stake.

**JIMMY**  
Oh, would you stage a SHOEY during *Death of a Salesman,* too? Spill White Claw on Willy Loman’s *grave* while you’re at it?  

Tony sighs deeply, dragging himself back into the debate like it’s a job he didn’t apply for.  

**TONY**  
You’re overthinking it. Some play-to-movie adaptations work better than live stage shit. Like *The Odd Couple.*  

The room freezes—not the kind of silence where there’s no response, but the kind where everyone’s bracing for the incoming storm. Nina raises an eyebrow. Becky leans forward like she just got fresh popcorn. Jimmy? Jimmy’s eyes narrow like he’s plotting Tony’s demise.  

**JIMMY**  
*(low, dangerous)*  
The *Odd Couple*...? Practically a live taping, Tony! You just get more *angles.* That’s NOT the same thing!  

**TONY**  
*(unflinching)*  
More angles make it better. You wanna stare at the same shitty apartment set for three hours or use the movie to, oh, I dunno, MOVE AROUND ONCE IN AWHILE?  

Jimmy staggers, completely winded like Tony just hit him with a folding chair.  

**JIMMY**  
You don’t MOVE AROUND during *The Odd Couple!* You *linger!* That apartment is a narrative MICROSCOSM of their shared dysfunction! It’s not about MOVING AROUND—  

**NINA**  
*(cutting him off, smug)*  
He’s got a point, Screwball. The angles? Top-tier shit. Kinda worked.  

Jimmy spins toward her, betrayal written deep in his bones.  

**JIMMY**  
Really, Nina?! You think adding one low-angle shot of the apartment’s SHITTY ICEBOX somehow translates the *entire depth of Neil Simon’s character study?!*  

Becky raises her soda cup like she’s toasting.  

**BECKY**  
Damn, I dunno, Jimmy. They kinda nailed it with that icebox. Visual metaphor. Very highbrow.  

Jimmy throws his hands in the air like he’s surrendering to God during a lightning storm.  

**JIMMY**  
YOU’RE ALL BARBARIANS.  

**TONY**  
*(deadpan, unbothered)*  
The ‘60s icebox looked cool as fuck. Deal with it.  

Becky grins, turning back toward Tony.  

**BECKY**  
What about *Biloxi Blues*?  

Nina leans against the counter, smirking even harder now.  

**NINA**  
Oh yeah, that one’s practically a movie already.  

Jimmy clutches the edge of the counter like it’s the only thing keeping him from physically fighting someone.  

**JIMMY**  
*Practically?* You think Eugene Morris Jerome losing his shit in boot camp is better ON FILM than what Broderick did ON STAGE?  

Tony raises one slow eyebrow.  

**TONY**  
He did it better *on film.* Your move, theater boy.  

Jimmy visibly short-circuits. He walks to the kitchen, grabs a random slice of leftover pizza, walks back to Tony and points it at him like a weapon.

**JIMMY**  
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN FILM SOMETHING DOESN’T MEAN YOU SHOULD!  

Becky loses her shit completely, finally laughing so hard she nearly drops her soda.  

**BECKY**  
Oh my god, you need meds, Screwball.  

Jimmy and Tony stare each other down like an old Western, Tony still unflinching. Nina steps between them slowly, holding her hands up like a fake mediator trying not to laugh too hard.  

**NINA**  
Alright, alright, let’s take a breath before somebody chokes on crust. Can we all just agree that play-to-film depends on context?  

Jimmy starts pointing wildly at *everyone*.  

**JIMMY**  
See! Context! CONTEXT! NOW YOU CARE ABOUT DEPTH— You *DICKS!*

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - CONTINUOUS  

Tom steps inside, box of supplies tucked under his arm, stopping dead in his tracks at the sight before him:  

- Nina leaning over the counter, jabbing one flour-covered hand into Becky’s direction.  
- Becky perched defensively at the booth, soda cup frozen mid-sip like she’s ready for war.  
- Tony still in his corner, scrolling idly on his phone, clearly *listening to everything* while pretending not to care.  
- And Jimmy, standing near the soda machine, chewing absentmindedly on a breadstick as he watches like this argument is a free improv show.  

Tom stares at his dysfunctional crew.  

**TOM**  
*(already done)*  
What?

Becky flings her arm dramatically toward Nina.  

**BECKY**  
This dumb bitch thinks she’s better than deep dish. That’s what’s happening.  

Nina scoffs, throwing up both her hands like Becky’s the lunatic here.  

**NINA**  
Better *than* deep dish? I’m sorry—is that seriously a fucking question? Thin crust *is* better. It’s pizza, not a casserole.  

Tom groans, shaking his head as he sets the box down on the counter.  

**TOM**  
I'm begging you to stop.  

Becky slams her soda onto the table, leaning forward with the full intensity of a gladiator preparing for battle.  

**BECKY**  
Deep dish is *real pizza,* Nina. It’s the *main event.* Thin crust is a fucking appetizer.  

Nina points at Becky, jabbing the air with aggressive certainty.  

**NINA**  
No—the second you have to eat it with a goddamn FORK, it stops being pizza.  

Jimmy perks up slightly at the mention of forks, half-smirking as he pops the rest of the breadstick into his mouth.  

**JIMMY**  
For the record, deep dish with a fork kinda feels like cheating. Just sayin’.  

Becky glares at him instantly.  

**BECKY**  
Screwball, stay out of this unless you’re willing to commit.  

Jimmy holds up both his hands in mock-surrender, still chewing.  

**JIMMY**  
I’m a thin guy, but I’m not tryna like... *die* for it, y’know?

Nina shoots him a warning look for the "ladies" comment before refocusing entirely on Becky.  

**NINA**  
Look, if I wanted to drown in melted cheese and regret, I'd eat lasagna—not pizza pretending to be cheesecake.  

Tom blinks, rubbing his temple like he’s debating whether to call an exorcist.  

**TOM**  
Can we *not* throw hands over bread today?  

Becky ignores him entirely, turning her full focus back to Nina.  

**BECKY**  
If you’re seriously trying to tell me that thin crust— THIN CRUST— holds a candle to the majesty of an overloaded deep dish, then honestly, Nina? You piece of shit.  

Nina barks out a laugh, incredulous.  

**NINA**  
Oh, please, Becky. You think you’re better just because you eat your pizza with two hands like a fucking... hamburger person?  

Becky leans IN, unphased and full of serotonin from absolutely wrecking thin crust.  

**BECKY**  
Call me crazy, but I like my pizza with a hefty dose of *satisfaction.* Don’t blame me because your pizza looks like someone ran it over with a bicycle.  

Jimmy starts laughing quietly in the background but quickly chokes it down when Nina spins on him.  

**NINA**  
*(pointing angrily)*  
What are you laughing at?! You just agreed with me two minutes ago!  

Jimmy raises his hands again, breadstick completely forgotten.  

**JIMMY**  
Just vibing, here. I'm a pizza centrist.

**NINA**  
Oh, so you’re Switzerland now? Real bold, Screwball.  

**BECKY**  
*(cutting in smugly)*  
Switzerland’s on my side. You’ve got Britain— cute, but you've never tasted anything but shit-ass water crisps.  

Nina full-on DECKS a rolled dough ball onto the counter so hard it makes a wet THUD.  

**NINA**  
Deep dish is a *crime.* Farms LOST CROPS so your clunky, useless carbuncle could exist.  

Tony sets down his phone finally, speaking too casually, like a man hurling gasoline onto an open flame.  

**TONY**  
I dunno. Think I’d rather have a slice of soggy deep dish than a crunchy-ass thin crust that breaks in your hands.  

Both Nina and Becky turn on him instantly, now unified against a *new* enemy.  

**BECKY**  
Did you just… describe ALL crusts badly?  

**NINA**  
Oh good, now *everyone* hates you!  

**BECKY**  
*(snapping immediately)*  
Tell Nina she’s wrong about thin crust, Tom. Just *do it.*  

Nina smirks, spinning toward him as if she’s been waiting for this moment.  

**NINA**  
Oh no, I think *Tom* has TASTE. He wouldn’t side with a Goulash pretending to be pizza.  

Tom, for a brief moment, looks at Nina. Then at Becky. Then at Nina again. He inhales slowly, clearly weighing his words.  

**TOM**  
Well, first of all…  

Everybody leans in, waiting for his judgment from the mountaintop. He turns toward Becky and grins.  

**TOM (CONT'D)**  
Thin crust is obviously superior.  

The room *erupts*.  

Jimmy chokes on a laugh, barely recovering before Becky slams her soda onto the table. Nina beams like she just got crowned Queen of All Pizza. Tony shakes his head, leaning against the VHS counter with a smug smirk slowly spreading across his face.  

**BECKY**  
*(absolute betrayal)*  
You’re LYING, Tom! You love deep dish! I’ve SEEN YOU SCARF HALF A DEEP DISH IN A SINGLE *SHIFT!*  

**TOM**  
Doesn’t mean it qualifies as superior, does it?  

Nina snickers, arms crossed as she watches Becky absolutely lose it.  

**NINA**  
Wow, Becky. That’s tough. Even the boss prefers crispy pizza over your doughy sadness pies.  

Becky whirls on Screwball, who is half-heartedly wiping down the soda machine while trying not to laugh.  

**BECKY**  
Screwball. Back me up. Tom loves deep dish. This thin crust charade is *bullshit!*  

Jimmy freezes mid-wipe like a deer caught in the headlights.  

**JIMMY**  
Look, I’m not trying to get caught in some marital custody battle over crust types. Y’all can fight without me.  

Tom raises a hand, cool and composed, to cut them both off.  

**TOM**  
You know what? I *do* love deep dish.  

Becky starts to grin, already gearing up to celebrate—until Tom finishes the sentence.  

**TOM (CONT'D)**  
But I prefer thin crust.  

Becky’s face drops faster than a soggy slice sliding off a paper plate.  

**BECKY**  
You’re lying! You’re lying just to piss me off!  

**TOM**  
*(shrugging)*  
Or maybe I’ve just realized that thin crust is pizza in its purest form. Less bread. Less filler. Just actual pizza.  

**NINA**  
*(delighted, clapping her hands)*  
Oh, man. Boss gets it. This is a good day.  

Becky glares at Nina with fire blazing in her eyes.  

**BECKY**  
I swear to God—  

Tony finally interjects, smirking as he taps ash from his cigarette.  

**TONY**  
Hey, Becky. I'm barely paying attention, but it’s two against one now. Maybe it’s you who has terrible taste.  

Becky spins toward Tony like he just killed her puppy.  

**BECKY**  
You’ve BEEN Team Deep Dish all day! You can’t flip just to troll me!  

Tony shrugs, smug as hell.  

**TONY**  
Call it persuasion? Or spite. I don't care.

Becky looks at the three of them— Tom, Nina, Tony— all united against her in this pizza holy war. Her last hope— the only one she hasn’t screamed at— is Jimmy. She locks eyes on him like a player handing the ball to the scrappy underdog in the final minute of the game.  

**BECKY**  
Jimmy. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. SAY SOMETHING.  

Jimmy hesitates, wavering like he knows no answer will save him now. He glances at Tom, then Nina, then Becky, then Tony. Finally, he throws his hands up like he’s waving a white flag.  

**JIMMY**  
Fine, okay. If we’re being honest? I mean… *both* are fine, right?  

The room goes deadly silent.  

**NINA and BECKY**  
*(horrified)*  
Both?!  

**TONY**  
There’s always one puss.

Tom just stares flatly at Jimmy, shaking his head in disbelief.  

**TOM**  
Screwball, that might be the most spineless thing you’ve ever said.

Jimmy shrugs, doing a poor job masking how thrilled he is that nobody’s actually throwing punches.  

**JIMMY**  
I’m Switzerland... I’m Switzerland.

---

INT. VHS PIZZA - KITCHEN - LATER  

Becky sits at the booth, working her way through something suspiciously resembling a deep dish pizza. Nina’s wiping down the counter, still smug from winning the majority vote. Tony’s back to messing with the rewinder. Jimmy, meanwhile, is casually toasting some bread in the kitchen.  

Tom leans by the counter, arms crossed, watching the relative calm return with a deep sigh of relief. He focuses on breathing. 

Jimmy pokes his head out from the kitchen holding his toasty creation.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh, don’t worry. I’m about to piss all of you off again.  

**TOM**  
*(already bracing himself)*  
What the hell’s that?  

Jimmy grins like a man who’s about to commit culinary blasphemy.  

**JIMMY**  
Pizza chips. Thin crust, no toppings, just tomato sauce- toasted to perfection.  

Nina and Becky both freeze mid-motion, turning to stare at him like he personally desecrated their ancestors.  

**NINA**  
Screwball, you better shut that idea down before I bury you in a bag of flour.  

Jimmy smirks, taking an obnoxiously loud crunch of the pizza chip.  

**JIMMY**  
Mmmm. Delicious.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - AFTERNOON  

The day has settled into its usual rhythm: barely functional chaos with bouts of forced productivity. Tony sits as usual at the VHS repair counter, unlit cigarette precariously dangling from his lips, fiddling with an old rewinder for the eighty-seventh time today.  

Tom leans against the counter, watching Tony like he’s trying to figure out whether poking this bear is gonna be hilarious or dangerous.  

**TOM**  
You ever think about… y’know, quitting?  

Tony doesn’t even bother looking up.  

**TONY**  
Every day.  

**TOM**  
*(to clarify)*  
I meant smoking.  

Tony stops fiddling with the rewinder, turns ever so slightly, the cigarette still dangling, and gives Tom a once-over like he just suggested something deeply offensive.  

**TONY**  
Uh, well, in that case, no.  

Before Tom can respond, Becky, sprawled in a booth with her feet up on the table, perks up like a crow spotting roadkill.  

**BECKY**  
*laughing*  
Oh, this I gotta hear. What’s your excuse, Tony?   

Nina pops her head out from the kitchen, grinning, already sensing trouble.  

**NINA**  
Wait, wait— Tony quitting smoking? Isn’t that, like… the cornerstone of his personality? 

Jimmy, leaning against the soda machine, chimes in with the biggest shit-eating grin he can muster.  

**JIMMY**  
Nah, quitting cigarettes would leave, like, an *existential void,* man. You’d have to start vaping or something.  

Tony finally looks up, aiming the full weight of his disdain directly at Jimmy.  

**TONY**  
If anyone catches me vaping, just shoot me on the spot. Make it clean.  

**TOM**  
*(deadpan)*  
You realize you’re slowly *already* doing that to yourself, right?  

Tony exhales a stream of smoke that practically spells out the word “bullshit” and shrugs.  

**TONY**  
Yeah, but slower. And with style.  

Becky points at him, laughing through every word.  

**BECKY**  
Oh my God— you are *so* full of shit.  

Tony leans back, this time with his rehearsed, kicked-back ‘fuck your input’ energy, and sparks another angle.  

**TONY**  
Look, quitting’s not in the cards. If I wanted to live long enough to be miserable, I’d delete this place from my resume and join a spin class.  

**NINA**  
*(grinning)*  
C’mon, Tony, what’s so scary about quitting? Doesn't it sound like freedom? Unchained from that... ridiculous... poison?    

Tony throws her the kind of look that would shut most people down instantly. Unfortunately, *this crew* thrives on ignoring those looks.  

**TONY**  
Oh yeah, *sure.* Let me sacrifice the one thing in my life keeping me from beating all of you to death with a pizza peel. Sounds real healthy.  

**NINA**
Pizza peel? He's given this some thought.

Jimmy leans forward, eyes practically glowing with chaotic potential.  

**JIMMY**  
Dude, what happens when you live to, like, *80*? You still chain-smoking then? Two Marlboros at once, oxygen tank on standby, thriving?  

Tony doesn’t miss a beat.  

**TONY**  
If I’m 80, Jimmy, I’ll light a cigarette off my fucking birthday candles and do donuts in your shitty, Tesla-powered wheelchair.  

Becky practically falls out of the booth she’s laughing so hard.  

**BECKY**  
Oh my god, what the *hell* is wrong with you?  

Tony doesn’t even react—he’s fully loaded now.  

**TONY**  
Self-preservation is overrated. Life’s way more fun when you stop pretending survival is a personality.  

**TOM**  
*(folding his arms)*  
And death by Marlboros *is*?  

**TONY**  
Hey, it’s honest.  

The silence that follows is deafening, everyone watching Tony with a sort of horrified admiration. Finally, Tom shakes his head and turns to walk away.  

**TOM**  
*(muttering as he walks away)*  
You know it’s gonna be me delivering your eulogy, right?  

Tony picks up his cigarette and leans back, triumphant as hell.  

**TONY**  
Don't make it boring.

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - SUNDAY AFTERNOON  

The little door CHIME rings as a RANDOM CUSTOMER strolls in, slow and easy, with *absolute stoner energy*. Mid-20s, sunglasses still on indoors, his vibe screams “this guy spent his morning hotboxing a Subaru in the Walmart parking lot.” He grins, confident but hazy, like he’s not entirely sure where he is—but wherever it is, it’s *great*. Think *Dave Franco* after two edibles and a beer.

Becky watches him from her booth, narrowing her eyes instantly. Tom stands behind the counter, taking this guy in with a mix of curiosity and dread. Nina is kneading dough in the back, humming faintly to herself. Tony’s at his usual spot at the VHS repair desk, ashing his cigarette onto a napkin.  

The customer strides up to the counter and flashes his *“aren’t I charming?”* grin.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Heyyyyy, what’s up? Weekend good?  

Tom scans him like he’s reading this dude’s entire résumé in one glance.  

**TOM**  
Yeah… it was.  

Becky perks up instantly, already *living* for the chaos energy this might unlock.  

**BECKY**  
Oh, this guy. This guy’s gonna be great.  

The Random Customer doesn’t even register her sarcasm. He’s too busy leaning onto the counter, sunny as hell.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Alright, cool-cool-cool. So, here’s the deal. I’ll take… thin crust pepperoni. Extra crispy. Like, real crispy. *Zen-level crispy, geometric center cut.* Got me?  

Becky freezes mid-sip of her soda, her jaw dropping as she processes what he just said.  

**BECKY**  
Thin crust?!  

The Random Customer turns to her, still grinning, completely oblivious to the storm brewing in her pupils.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Yeah. Thin crust. Wild crispy. Feels, like… *elevated*, y’know?  

Tom leans forward slightly, one eyebrow raising as he delivers his deathblow line with surgical precision.  

**TOM**  
I gotta ask, man... are *you* extra crispy right now?  

The customer blinks, slightly slow on the uptake. And then it clicks.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Ohhhh. Oh, *damn*, man, you caught me. Yeah, yeah— might be a little crispy myself.  

Jimmy practically falls onto the soda machine, holding-in laughter too hard to stand upright.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh my god, are you pitching that to Shark Tank next?  

Becky slams her soda down and stands up, storming toward the counter like this is now a personal crusade.  

**BECKY**  
Forget Zen! Hold up. Did you seriously walk in here and—*of all the pizzas in existence*—you ordered THIN CRUST? On MY shift?  

The Random Customer tilts his head, clearly confused but still vibing.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Uh… yeah? What’s wrong with thin crust?  

**BECKY**  
What’s wrong with it?! It’s not a pizza—it’s a fucking cracker with pepperoni on it.  

Nina, who’s sauntered out of the kitchen now, wipes her hands on her apron, clearly enjoying the show but interjects out of pure chaos obligation.  

**NINA**  
Hey, hey. Thin crust has its place. It’s quick. Efficient. Great for normal people who don’t wanna spend thirty minutes fighting a pizza that’s also a nasty-ass bread bowl.  

Becky whirls on her, pointing wildly like it’s a courtroom drama.  

**BECKY**  
You SHUT your TRAITOR MOUTH, Nina.  

Tom sighs, rubbing his temples because *this is his life now*.  

**TOM**  
Guys, c’mon— he’s *stoned*. If he wants wild crispy cardboard, let him have wild crispy cardboard.  

The Random Customer raises both hands like he’s under arrest but still chill about it.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Whoa-whoa, no need to come at me with the cracker hate, alright? Thin crust just feels… sophisticated, you know? It’s like, I’m at a wine bar, but instead of cheese cubes, I have this delicate little—  

Tony, who has been quietly smoking and observing the entire time, finally slams his cigarette into the ashtray and speaks.  

**TONY**  3
Holy shit, if this guy says “delicate” again, I’ll shart on his pizza and call it caviar.

The Random Customer blinks at him, clearly misinterpreting Tony’s tone as *banter.*  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Alright, man, good energy—liking it. Very sharp.  

Jimmy wheezes, clapping a little breadstick for no reason.  

**JIMMY**  
Tony’s gonna "zen this guy's chakras".  

**TONY**  
Oh, I don’t hit stoners. Too easy.  

Becky still won’t let it go, jabbing a finger toward the Customer’s very existence.  

**BECKY**  
Listen here, Crisp. If you’re putting thin crust in your mouth, I don’t care how “elevated” you are. You lose every ounce of pizza respect. Period.  

The guy—still entirely too chill for this—flashes his grin again like he thinks this is just the best day ever.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Alright, counterpoint: What if I just… don’t have pizza respect?  

The room goes absolutely silent. Not a breath. Nothing. Nina freezes mid-motion. Jimmy’s grin melts into shock. Even Tony stares, practically waiting for Becky to spontaneously combust from *pure rage.*  

**BECKY**  
…Fuckin’ WHAT?!  

LATER:  

The Random Customer sits in a booth alone, crunching on his thin crust pepperoni with sunglasses back on indoors like he’s fully leaned into this disaster. Becky’s behind the counter now, staring daggers at him every chance she gets.  

**TOM**  
*(to Becky)*  
You know exacting revenge on stoners is a bad look, right?  

**BECKY**  
Yeah. But it’s worth it.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - LATER  

The Random Customer is still lounging in the booth corner, sunglasses on, casually eating his thin crust pepperoni pizza as if he hadn’t already caused a minor riot just by existing. The guy radiates “too chill to care” energy, completely unbothered.  

Nina’s behind the counter, working the dough. She keeps glancing in his direction—subtly at first, then far less subtly. Jimmy notices immediately, of course, because he’s *Jimmy*.  

**JIMMY**  
Uh-oh. What’s this?  

Nina freezes mid-knead, her hands buried in dough like she’s about to crush it into a pancake.  

**NINA**
(feeling cornered)
What’s WHAT?  

**JIMMY**  
*(grinning, leaning in obnoxiously)*  
You’ve been side-eyeing Mr. Zen Geometry for, like, five minutes.  

**NINA**  
I’m literally just… making dough. Chill your ass.  

Jimmy crosses his arms, smirking so hard it’s physically painful.  

**JIMMY**  
Are you *extra crispy* right now, Nina? Cause you’re acting sus as hell.  

**NINA**  
Shut *UP*, Screwball.  

By now, Becky has also caught on. She sets her soda down slowly, leaning closer like some kind of predator sizing up its prey.  

**BECKY**
Oh my god. Nina. Do you— do you HAVE A CRUSH on *thin crust guy*?  

Nina immediately glares at her, defensive as hell.  

**NINA**  
What?! Of course not.

Becky doesn’t buy it for a second.  

**BECKY**  
Oh my GOD. You DO. You are *so into him.*  

Nina tries to focus harder on kneading the dough, but her hands are moving way too fast, her face slightly pink.  

**NINA**  
I didn’t say that. That’s YOUR weird little assumption, Becky. Maybe YOU’RE into him.  

**BECKY**  
Absolutely not. Dude eats overcooked cracker-pizza and says "zen" like it’s a personality. That’s not my type. But you? Oh yeah. You are *losing it* for Thin Crust Franco over there.  

**NINA**  
I *am NOT losing it!*  

This is the moment where Tom, who’s been very deliberately ignoring this chaos, finally steps in with a tired sigh.  

**TOM**  
What's this?

Becky grins and points at Nina without hesitation.  

**BECKY**  
She has a huge crush on Wild Crispy.  

**NINA**  
Can you all just STOP?! I don’t “have a crush.” You’re literally retarded.  

Jimmy fake-gasps, covering his mouth like he’s part of a daytime soap opera.  

**JIMMY**  
Ooooh, she denied it too fast. That’s basically a confession.  

Nina slams her dough onto the counter dramatically.  

**NINA**  
I'm NOT confessing shit! I just think… y’know, the guy’s kinda—  

She pauses, realizing anything she says here will be used against her.  

**BECKY**  
*(instantly leaning in)*  
Kinda WHAT? Say it... Say it bitch. No take-backs.  

**NINA**  
Ugh. Fine. He’s… *attractive*.  

Everyone collectively LOSES IT. Jimmy trips over the stool he’s been leaning on, Becky is doubled over on the counter wheezing, and even Tony— of all people— lets out a low, sarcastic chuckle from the VHS corner.  

**TONY**  
“Attractive” is Nina for “he’s a goddamn Adonis and I’m goddamn dripping.”  

**NINA**  
I *hate* all of you.  

The crew is clearly not letting this go anytime soon. Becky straightens up, brushing tears from her eyes as she gasps:  

**BECKY**  
Wait, wait— should we wingman her? Like go over there and—  

Nina’s eyes widen in panic.  

**NINA**  
Don’t fucking dare.  

**BECKY**  
Aww, c’mon! I’m great at setting people up. I’ll just waltz over there and be like—  

She shifts into a faux-bro voice so bad it’s almost offensive.  

**BECKY (CONT'D)**  
“Hey, wanna split your geometry pizza with that cute flour-covered chick over by the dough roller?”  

Nina groans, dropping her face into her hands.  

**NINA**  
Asshole. I’m gonna kill you in your sleep, Becky.  

From the corner, Tom chimes in, completely deadpan.  

**TOM**  
Gonna be rough explaining that one to HR. “Yeah, she murdered her coworker because she wouldn’t stop wingman-ing her at work.” Real relatable shit.  

Jimmy grabs his soda now, recovering enough to add his two cents.  

**JIMMY**  
You know what? I think we *should* help her. We owe it to pizza.  

Nina SLAMS her rolling pin down onto her dough, as if it's someone's skull, immediately shutting the room into silence.  

**NINA**  
I don’t need HELP.  

Tony tilts his head thoughtfully, watching her reaction with just enough amusement to make it worse.  

**TONY**  
You sure? I mean, your face looks like our sauce.  

The fuse is lit. Nina spins on all of them, pointing aggressively.  

**NINA**  
If any of you assholes even LOOK at that table, I swear to God—  

The Random Customer looks up from his thin crust monstrosity just in time to lock eyes with Nina during her mid-rant. She freezes.  

**BECKY**  
*(whispering)*  
…Awwwwww, he caught your vibe.  

LATER:  

Nina’s fully given up and is wiping down the counter aggressively while the Random Customer strolls out, sunglasses still on, clutching a to-go box for the pizza he didn’t finish. He flashes his signature grin at her on the way out.  

**RANDOM CUSTOMER**  
Great pizza. You guys are fuckin' pimp.  

Nina mutters something unintelligible under her breath, refusing to meet his gaze. Becky slaps her boob.

**BECKY**  
Say BYE, dumbass.  

**NINA**  
*(blushing, mutters louder)*  
Bye.  

The customer waves as he heads out the door. The silence that follows is deafening. Then:  

**JIMMY**  
Okay, so when’s the wedding?  

**NINA**  
I’ll rip out your under-educated throat.

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - LATER  

The Random Customer is long gone, but the aftermath of his visit still lingers in the air as the crew messes with Nina about her painfully obvious crush. Becky, perched at the counter like a cat toying with a cornered mouse, smirks while Nina aggressively wipes flour off the counter like it owes rent. Tom leans nearby, sipping flat soda as Becky gleefully continues prying.  

**BECKY**  
You’re not gonna admit you were into him? Really? Not even a *little*?  

**NINA**  
There’s nothing TO admit. He was just some stoner nerd who ordered bad pizza, okay? No chemistry, nothing. Move on.  

Becky raises an eyebrow suspiciously.  

**BECKY**  
Hmm. “No chemistry, nothing.” Okay. Sure. So if he hadn’t walked out, you… definitely wouldn’t have slid him your number with a cute note, right?  

**NINA**  
Correct.  

**BECKY**  
Even though I *distinctly* heard you call him “not terrible" under your breath five minutes ago?  

**NINA**  
That was sarcasm. Get therapy.  

Jimmy, pitching in from the corner as he fidgets with a soda lid, grins like he’s about to make things worse.  

**JIMMY**  
Nah, Nina’s into guys like that. I mean, we all have types, right? She’s just vibing with her “geometry pizza stoners” phase. Everyone experiments.  

Nina freezes for half a second, visibly narrowing her eyes like she’s about to throw something heavy.  

**NINA**  
What’s that supposed to mean?  

Jimmy blinks, trying to backpedal instantly.  

**JIMMY**  
Nothing! I just mean, like, c’mon, *relationships* are messy. People hook up, move on, whatever. No big deal.  

Becky, sharp as hell, picks up on this strange wording immediately. She stares between Nina and Jimmy like she’s trying to solve a brain teaser.  

**BECKY**  
Wait. Hold. The fuck. Up.  

Nina and Jimmy both freeze mid-motion.  

**BECKY (CONT'D)**  
Are you two acting weird because you…?  

Tom glances up from his empty receipt pad at Becky’s sudden shift in tone.  

**TOM**  
Don’t say it.  

**BECKY**  
*(ignoring him, dramatic whisper)*  
Oh my GOD. You two FUCKED, didn’t you?  

Nina drops her damp towel onto the nearest counter with a loud *slap,* her face suddenly turning pink as she fiercely avoids making eye contact.  

**NINA**  
Becky. Shut your dumb-bitch-hole.  

Becky LEAPS out of her chair like someone just confirmed Elvis faked his death.  

**BECKY**  
YOU DID! OH MY GOD, YOU *DID!*  

Jimmy groans audibly, slouching against the soda machine like he just realized he’s never living this down.  

**JIMMY**  
This is why nobody ever tells Becky *shit.*  

**NINA**  
SCREWBALL!!

**BECKY**  
I knew it! No wonder you two fight like a couple that broke up over Netflix passwords. It makes *so much sense.*  

Nina clenches her jaw, grabbing for the flour container like she’s debating if physical violence will solve her problems.  

**NINA**  
It was like… forever ago. It doesn't count. So DROP IT.  

Naturally, Becky does no such thing. She’s having the time of her *life*.  

**BECKY**  
Oh no, I can’t drop this— it’s too good. It was the Christmas party, wasn’t it? Fucking knew it— blame the eggnog entirely.  

Jimmy points vaguely at Becky with zero enthusiasm.  

**JIMMY**  
See? Told you she’d figure it out. You can’t give her context clues; She's such a dick.

Nina finally slams her fists onto the counter with enough force to shake the nearby spice rack.  

**NINA**  
Look, Becky, so help me, if you say ONE more word about this—  

Tony, perched like a king in the corner with his trademark cigarette, interrupts like he’s been watching an improv show and waiting for his cue.  

**TONY**  
If she doesn’t, I will. Both of you getting drunk and sloppy at a company party? Disgusting. Staff hookup clichés are beneath me.  

Jimmy glares at him.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh, screw you, man. Like you’ve never had a moment with a homly co-worker.  

**NINA**
Homly?

**TONY**  
Yeah, but my moments are memorable. Yours sound like a Thursday.  

Becky HOWLS with laughter, grabbing Jimmy’s shoulder.  

**BECKY**  
Oh, dude. Get rammed, fucker.

Tom, folding receipts into paper airplanes now, looks over to Nina, who’s clearly seconds away from combusting.  

**TOM**  
Can I just clarify… is this gonna blow up in my face HR-wise or can we just let it die in the *deep, dark pit of ungodly things that fly over my head*?  

**NINA**  
DEEP PIT. Nothing to care about. Nothing important.

**BECKY**  
*(grinning)*  
Ohhh shit. Don’t think I forgot about the two of you cozying up by the Christmas tree. Santa saw shit that night, didn’t he?  

Nina chucks an entire handful of flour directly into Becky’s face. White powder EXPLODES into the air as Becky stumbles back, cracking up.  

**JIMMY**  
*(muttering)*  
Yup. Murderous tension confirmed. Feels about right.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER  

Becky is still brushing flour out of her hair from the bomb Nina just launched at her, but she’s grinning like a kid who just found every present under the Christmas tree. Nina has gone full flustered panic mode, trying desperately to act like nothing is happening as she aggressively kneads dough.  

Tom is leaning on the counter with the resigned calm of a man who’s accepted this dumpster fire as his life. Jimmy sits on a nearby stool, hiding his face behind a soda cup like he hopes invisibility is an option. Tony stays in the corner, exhaling cigarette smoke and just waiting for this shit to escalate because of *course* it will.  

**TOM**
Put that out, Tony!

**BECKY**  
You wanna play, Nina? Fine. Flour’s cute and all… but I fight dirty.  

Without hesitation, Becky spins on her heel, grabs the register slip with Random Customer’s phone number burned into it, and holds it up like she just pulled the pin from a grenade.  

**NINA**  
*(horrified)*  
Becky. Don’t you fucking *dare.*  

Becky glares at her with pure, unfiltered gremlin energy.  

**BECKY**  
Have you fucking *met me?*

**NINA**  
You will wake up without a face.

**BECKY**  
Worth it!  

Tom straightens slightly, pointing lazily at Becky.  

**TOM**  
Don’t.

**BECKY**  
I’m gonna.  

**TOM**  
Becky, really *don’t.*  

**BECKY**  
*(already dialing the number)*  
Oops. Too late.  

Nina slams her hands onto the counter, fully abandoning her dough now.  

**NINA**  
Becky, I will fuck—  

But Becky’s already holding the phone to her ear, smirking like a villain as it starts ringing.  

**BECKY**  
Hello? Is this Thin Crust Geometry Boy?  

Jimmy makes the loudest choking sound, nearly falls off his stool. Tony leans forward, suddenly way more invested in life.  

**TONY**  
She didn't.

**NINA**  
*(complete panic)*  
Hang up the phone, Becky... *HANG IT UP!*  

**BECKY**  
*(ignoring Nina, cheerful)*  
Hi! Yeah, so you ordered some “extra crispy” thin crust earlier. You remember? Yeah, yeah, with the *delicate vibes* or whatever. Anyway, the crew and I were just wondering—  

She grins at Nina like she’s about to drop a bomb on Hiroshima.  

**BECKY (CONT'D)**  
—are you, like, *single*?  

Nina SCREAMS, lunging across the counter, but Becky sidesteps with agility that could rival an Olympic athlete, dodging Nina’s wild grab.  

**NINA**  
BECKY! 

Tom goes to take a shit.

**MR. ZEN (V.O.)**  
*(from the phone, chill as ever)*  
Uh… who’s asking?  

Becky’s grin spreads so wide it’s criminal.  

**BECKY**  
Oh, just a friendly coworker looking out for a friend. You know Nina? Cute girl, killer sarcasm, works dough like an artist? She’s just wondering if you’re into—  

Before Becky can finish, Nina SNATCHES the phone out of her hand, nearly breaking it in her frenzy, and slams it against her chest like she’s worried it might explode.  

**NINA**  
*(into the phone, gasping)*  
Hi! Sorry! Ignore her! She’s insane. We just let her work here out of pity!  

Becky howls with laughter, leaning dramatically against the counter.  

**BECKY**  
Oh, so you DON’T wanna ask him out? Cool-cool-cool. Just checking.  

Nina turns her back on Becky completely, face red as marinara, and lowers her voice so none of them can hear her now.  

**NINA**  
*(into the phone, whispering)*  
I’m really sorry about that. Please don’t, like… block our number or anything. She’s just—*  
(pauses to glance back at Becky before whispering)  
—just a cunt.  

**MR. ZEN (V.O.)**  
*(still unfazed as ever)*  
Nah, it’s cool. Kinda digging this place’s weird vibes. You guys are fun. Nina… right?  

She freezes completely. Her face, which had been blazing with fury and humiliation, suddenly softens into something that could almost be shy disbelief.  

**NINA**  
Yeah, yep. That’s me.  

Her voice is quieter now, and suddenly, the crew notices. Jimmy raises his eyebrows at the subtle shift.  

**JIMMY**  
No way. Is she *melting?* Wow...

Tony exhales slowly, sitting back like he’s about to enjoy his favorite movie.  

**TONY**  
Make the move, you tranquil motherfucker.

Nina spins around fast, hand over the phone like she’s about to bash their brains in.

**NINA**  
*(feral whisper, like dry wheezing, no voice box)*  
Shut up. SHUT THE FUCK UP.  


LATER:  

Nina, bright red but strangely quiet, sets the phone down after hanging up. The room immediately goes silent as everyone watches her, waiting for the post-call fallout.  

**BECKY**  
…So what’d he say?  

Nina picks up bag of dusting flour and restrains herself from launching it at her.

**NINA**  
Never... speak... again.  

Becky SCREAMS and RUNS, but she’s laughing through it anyway.

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - EARLY EVENING  

The flour chaos has finally settled. Nina's wiping the counters furiously, radiating “pretend-nothing-happened” energy while Becky grins devilishly, flour still dusting her shoulders like war paint. Jimmy’s cleaning the soda machine, trying to act like a background character in his own drama. Tony casually leans on the counter near Tom, playing with a cigarette but not lighting it.  

The post-call tension hangs in the air like stale mozzarella, and it’s clear nobody’s letting go of everything that just went down.  

**BECKY**  
*(breaking the silence)*  
So. First date, huh?  

Nina groans loudly, chucking a damp towel at Becky’s face.  

**NINA**  
Becky, I swear on everything holy—  

**BECKY**  
*(catching the towel mid-air)*  
Ohhhh, don’t mind me. I’m just picturing you and Extra Crispy Dick out there, swapping geometry stories over veal. Cute.  

Jimmy smirks from the soda machine, not looking up.  

**JIMMY**  
Yeah, so cute they’ll probably make a rom-com out of it. What’s the tagline? “He taught her how to vibe; she taught him what a carb is.”  

Nina points her dough roller at Jimmy like a sword.  

**NINA**  
Screwball, I will ram this down your throat.  

Tom, leaning against the counter, groans softly.  

**TOM**  
What's the problem, Nina? Y'know, I wish someone would wing-man me... I wish I had loving, caring friends the way you do.

Tony, who’s been completely unbothered up until now, clears his throat casually.  

**TONY**  
Hey, boss.  

Tom glances at him, grateful for the distraction.  

**TOM**  
Yeah, Tony?  

Tony leans forward slightly, completely deadpan, eyes calm and steady.  

**TONY**  
Can I make a ham and American cheese pizza?  

The room freezes. Becky narrows her eyes, Jimmy actually stops mid-cleaning, and even Nina—who’d been borderline homicidal moments ago— blinks like she misheard him.  

**TOM**  
*(staring)*  
...What?  

**TONY**  
Ham. American cheese. Pizza dough. Really simple.  

Tom stares at him for a long moment, waiting for the punchline. It doesn’t come.  

**TOM**  
You joking?

**TONY**  
Nope.  

**BECKY**  
*(genuinely horrified)*  
Tony, what the fuck is wrong with you?

Tony shrugs, nonchalant as ever.  

**TONY**  
I mean, why not? It’s a classic combo. People make sandwiches with it all the time. Just throw it on some dough, bake it, and call it a day.  

**NINA**  
*(still blinking in mild horror)*  
Don’t call that shit “classic.” Nothing about what you just described is pizza.  

Tony raises an eyebrow.  

**TONY**  
Why not? It’s meat, cheese, and bread. Checks all the pizza boxes.  

**JIMMY**  
Does it check any *sanity* boxes, though?  

Tony leans back, casually spinning his unlit cigarette between two fingers.  

**TONY**  
I dunno. Maybe I’m bored. Maybe I just like messing with you guys. Or maybe—  

He smirks faintly, aiming directly at Tom.  

**TONY (CONT'D)**  
—maybe a guy should be able to guilt his boss into making him a comfort pizza every now and then, no questions asked.

Tom stares at him flatly for a long beat. Finally, he gestures weakly toward the kitchen.  

**TOM**  
Yeah, go ahead. Ruin the oven if you want. Just keep whatever hellspawn you’re about to bake wayyy *off my menu*.  

Tony grins faintly, giving Tom a small nod like he’s won something.  

**TONY**  
One ham-and-cheese, coming right up.  

As Tony walks toward the kitchen—calm, smug, and entirely too satisfied—Becky throws up her hands in disbelief.  

**BECKY**  
You’re letting him DO this?

Tom watches Tony disappear behind the swinging door, shaking his head.  

**TOM**  
Honestly? I’m just curious now, how far he’ll take it.  


LATER:  

The crew gathers around the kitchen counter as the ham-and-American-cheese pizza emerges from the oven. It’s a horrifying Frankenstein of melty orange globs and greasy dough. Tony sets it down with the confidence of a world-class chef presenting a Michelin-star dish.  

**JIMMY**  
…It looks like cheesy vomit.  

**BECKY**  
It looks like it’s gonna spawn another pandemic.  

Tony slices a small piece, picks it up, and takes a bite. He chews thoughtfully as the crew watches in disgusted fascination.

Finally, he swallows and shrugs.  

**TONY**  
Not bad.  

Everyone groans in unison.  

**TONY (CONT'D)**  
C’mon, it’s not *that* gross. Becky eats pineapple on hers, and nobody says shit.  

**BECKY**  
Whoa, WHOA. You don’t get to drag me into whatever midlife-crisis pie this is.  

**NINA**  
You’re a freak, Tony. I just want you to know that.  

Tony grins faintly, picking up another slice.  

**TONY**  
You haven't even tried it.

He takes another bite as the crew collectively cringes.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - KITCHEN - LATER  

The ham-and-American-cheese pizza sits ominously on the counter like a crime scene photo, still steaming. Tony calmly munches on another slice, radiating smug satisfaction, while the rest of the crew watches him like he’s ASMR-ing their nightmares in real time. Becky gags preemptively every time his teeth touch the crust.  

**BECKY**  
I can’t believe you actually ate TWO slices of that. You’re gonna die like six days earlier than planned now.  

**TONY**  
*(calmly eating)*  
We all die eventually. Might as well go out with a full life.  

**JIMMY**  
That is NOT a full life.

Tom, leaning against the counter, squints suspiciously at the melted abomination. He crosses his arms like he’s bracing himself for what he’s about to say.  

**TOM**  
Alright… screw it.  

The entire crew goes *dead silent*.  

Tom picks up a knife, slicing himself off a hesitant triangle of Tony’s Frankenpizza. He stares at the slice like it might literally explode in his hand.  

**TOM**  
Yea, I’m trying a bite. Why not?

**BECKY**  
*(horrified)*  
Tom, ew...

He takes a breath, and slowly takes a bite. The crew leans in, collectively waiting for him to choke, gag, or otherwise bleed from the eyes.  

…but that doesn’t happen.  

Tom’s expression softens. He chews thoughtfully, blinks a few times, and then—slowly— gives a small nod.  

**TOM**  
Huh.  

**BECKY**  
*(panicking)*  
“Huh”?!

**TOM**  
It’s…  

He takes another bite, this one noticeably less hesitant, and nods again.  

**TOM (CONT'D)**  
…it’s actually delicious.  

The room explodes.  

**BECKY**  
NO!  

**NINA**  
WHAT?!  

**JIMMY**  
DID YOUR TASTE BUDS DIE?!  

Tony, still smug as hell, eats another slice and gestures toward Tom like an artist showing off their gallery exhibit.  

**TONY**  
See? The boss gets it. Simple ingredients. No fuss. Hits like nostalgia on steroids.  

**BECKY**  
Tom, you don't have to do this.

Tom ignores her, taking another bite. His head tilts slightly in curiosity.  

**TOM**  
I mean, it’s missing something. Feels like it needs a little kick, y’know? Something salty, savory. Balance the cheese.  

Tony nods like a father approving his son’s first word.  

**TONY**  
You’re thinking pickles.  

**TOM**  
Exactly. Pickles.  

Jimmy recoils so hard he almost falls over.  

**JIMMY**  
PICKLES. ON. PIZZA!

Tony shrugs, unconcerned.  

**TONY**  
Why not? Tons of sandwiches do it. Works great on burgers. Gives you that briny punch, cuts through the fat.  

**JIMMY**  
*Fat?! CUT WHAT FAT? IT’S A PIZZA MADE OF TURMOIL.*  

Tom looks over at Jimmy now, eyebrow raised with calm amusement.  

**TOM**  
Y’know, you should try a slice, Screwball.  

Jimmy freezes like Tom just suggested he drink battery acid.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh HELL no.  

Tom grins faintly, the kind of grin that says, *I’m about to ruin your day for fun.*  

**TOM**  
C’mon. Don’t knock it ‘til you try it.  

**JIMMY**  
Nope. Absolutely not. I have dignity—  

**BECKY**  
*(snorting)*  
Since when? You once ate leftover garlic knots you found under the fryer, Jimmy. You’re not better than this.  

**JIMMY**  
That was different! That was *economically efficient!*  

**TOM**  
This could be efficient too. It’s practically a sandwich.  

Jimmy grabs the pizza slicer and holds it in defense.

**JIMMY**  
If you’re gonna blackmail me into eating this cheesy nonsense, you’re slicing me the absolute SMALLEST piece possible.  

Tom carves out the tiniest triangle imaginable and hands it to Jimmy, who stares at it like it’s about to bite him, not the other way around. The crew watches with giddy anticipation as Jimmy raises the slice to his mouth, grimacing the whole time.  

He takes a bite.  

There’s at least five seconds of silence as he chews in slow agony. And then…  

**JIMMY**  
…Oh no.  

**BECKY**  
*(gasps)*  
OH NO WHAT?!  

Jimmy swallows hard and stares at the pizza with wide, horrified eyes.  

**JIMMY**  
It’s… not terrible.  

Explosive chaos.  

**NINA**  
NOOOOO!  

**BECKY**  
JIMMY, YOU TRAITOR!  

Tony grins wider than ever now, holding his slice up like a toast.  

**TONY**  
Welcome to the dark side, kid.  

Jimmy groans, slamming the rest of the slice onto the nearest plate.  

**JIMMY**  
I hate myself. I hate all of you. But like… *he’s right*. Add pickles and this shit’d probably slap.  

Becky SCREAMS dramatically, throwing her apron onto the counter and storming off to the eatery.  

**BECKY**  
This place doesn’t DESERVE me.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - EVENING  

The restaurant is in full post-ham-and-cheese-pizza disaster mode. Tony is leaning back in a chair, savoring another slice of his controversial creation. Becky is still fake-pouting in the corner booth, pretending her existence was ruined by the mere sight of ham and American on pizza. Nina aggressively rolls dough in the kitchen, still clearly rattled from earlier conversations, while Tom oversees the fallout with his trademark “I need a new job” expression.  

The door CHIMES.  

Everyone turns as *Mr. Zen* strides in— sunglasses off this time, but still oozing his casual, too-cool-for-this-plane-of-existence charm. He’s got a single red rose in one hand, grinning like a rom-com lead who knows *exactly* what he’s doing.  

**MR. ZEN**  
What’s up, gang? Back so soon— I know!  

Nina freezes behind the counter, her hands gripping the dough roller like it’s the only thing keeping her from crumbling into a mess.  

Becky IMMEDIATELY perks up, throwing her arms into the air in victorious glee.  

**BECKY**  
Oh my god. It’s Prince Zen! Back for his faire maiden!  

**NINA**  
*(hissing under her breath)*  
SHUT UP BITCH.  

**JIMMY**  
*(leaning dangerously close to Zen)*  
Uh, bro. Cute gesture, but why stop at a *rose*? She’s worth at least two dozen. Step it up.  

Mr. Zen— being exactly who he is— just grins at Jimmy like they’re in on a secret.  

**MR. ZEN**  
Nah, man. Single rose says focus. Romantic minimalism, feel me?  

Jimmy blinks slowly, clearly caught between wanting to mock him and being impressed.  

**JIMMY**  
Romantic minimalism, huh? Alright, I dig it. One rose, one pizza... one sec. Did you even eat before you got here?  

Mr. Zen raises one eyebrow.  

**MR. ZEN**  
Not since my Nina revolutionized thin crust earlier. Why?  

Jimmy *grins.*  

**JIMMY**  
You gotta try the kitchen’s latest game-changer.  

Nina’s head snaps toward him, eyes wide with panic.  

**NINA**  
Jimmy, *don’t.*  

But Jimmy’s already bounding toward the now-infamous ham-and-American-cheese pizza sitting on the counter. He grabs a plate, slices a single, horrifying triangle, and presents it to Mr. Zen with the excitement of a kid building their first LEGO tower.  

**JIMMY**  
One *custom pizza,* hot off the chaos train, on the house. You’re welcome.  

Mr. Zen squints at the pizza, visibly unsure.  

**MR. ZEN**  
What… *is* it?  

Tony, without looking up from his current slice, chimes in casually.  

**TONY**  
Ham. American cheese. Bread. Pure genius.  

**BECKY**  
*(snapping from the booth)*  
Pure garbage. Don’t do it, Zen-man. They’re trying to destroy your taste buds.  

Tom, arms crossed behind the counter, looks up at both of them and sighs.  

**TOM**  
It’s queer, sure. But honestly? I'd order it if I were some dumb, 24yo,
(trailing off)
out-of-town, dick-fart fuck-face.

Mr. Zen blinks, glances at the pizza again, and then at Jimmy, who’s grinning like a stoned Cheshire cat.  

**MR. ZEN**  
You’re serious.  

**JIMMY**  
Dead serious. It’s a total mindfuck. You’re gonna hate how much you like it.  

Becky GAGS audibly from the booth, louder than necessary.  

**BECKY**  
He’s lying, bruh. Don’t fall for it. It’ll haunt your soul.  

Mr. Zen chuckles softly, shaking his head.  

**MR. ZEN**  
Y’all are way too into this.  

**TONY**  
*(shrugging)*  
Try it or don’t. Your enlightenment, not mine.  

There’s a tense pause as the whole room waits. Finally, Mr. Zen picks up the slice with calm deliberation and takes a small, tentative bite.  

The reactions are immediate:  

BECKY stares, waiting for him to crumple into a ball of regret. NINA watches nervously, her grip tightening on the dough roller. JIMMY leans forward like a scientist observing an experiment, absolutely gleeful. TONY, meanwhile, takes another casual drag of his cigarette, cool as ever.  

Mr. Zen chews slowly, his eyebrows raising slightly.  

**MR. ZEN**  
...Okay.  

The room JUMPS.  

**BECKY**  
“No!”  

**NINA**  
*(exasperated)*  
What the hell do you MEAN, “okay”?!  

Mr. Zen swallows, taking another thoughtful glance at the slice.  

**MR. ZEN**  
It’s weird. Like, aggressively weird. But… it works. Like- it's really creamy. Y'know what would work on this shit? Pickles.

**BECKY**  
*(slamming her hand against the booth)*  
STOP!! WHOEVER IS DOING THIS TO ME... PLEASE!

Mr. Zen laughs, holding the slice up like a trophy. A chewing, earnest smile.

**MR. ZEN**  
Y’all, I think I just ascended to flavor nirvana. Just *wait* til I tell my homies.

Tony FINALLY cracks a grin, leaning back in smug satisfaction.  

**TONY**  
Told ya. Pickles next time, and we take over the world.  

Nina slams her rolling pin onto the counter, shouting with pure indignation.  
Jimmy claps Mr. Zen on the back, laughing.  

**JIMMY**  
Welcome to the dark side, my dude.  

Tom merely watches the disaster unfold, nodding with an accomplished grin. He's going to hell and he likes it.

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - EVENING  

The aftermath of Mr. Zen’s ham-and-American-cheese-pizza enlightenment continues to echo across the pizzaria. Becky is still half-collapsed in her booth, dramatically mourning the downfall of pizza integrity. Jimmy’s grinning ear-to-ear, overly pleased with himself for converting *another soul to chaos consumption.* Tony, calm and smug as ever, leans back with a cigarette in hand, basking in his culinary victory. Nina stands by the counter with her dough roller, looking like she’s trying to decide whether to slap Tony, Jimmy, or Mr. Zen first.  

Tom emerges from the back, grabbing his jacket off the coat hook as he shakes his car keys in his pocket casually.  

**TOM**  
Who needs anything?  

The room goes dead silent as everyone stops to watch him.  

**BECKY**  
Wait. What?  

Tom slings the jacket over his shoulder like he’s casually walking off a movie set.  

**TOM**  
Grocery store. Before they close. Tony needs pickles.  

He tosses the sentence out so casually it takes a second for the room to register what he’s just said. And when it does? The reactions are IMMEDIATE.  

**BECKY**  
CUT IT OUT!  

**NINA**  
*TOM, STOP ENABLING HIM!*

**JIMMY**  
*(laughing uncontrollably)*  
Oh my god. Tom. You absolute MADMAN.  

Tony smirks faintly, flicking ash off his cigarette and tilting his chair back with ease.  

**TONY**  
Now there’s a boss who gets things done.  

Becky springs up from her booth so fast her soda nearly tips.  

**BECKY**  
Tom, I swear to GOD, if you walk out of here and come back with pickles, I will riot. I will burn this-

He interrupts.

**TOM**
(batman voice)
Relax. I’m only gone for ten minutes. Try not to burn the place down while I’m gone.  

**BECKY**  
*(yelling after him)*  
I WILL BURN IT! RIGHT TO THE GROUND!  

The door CHIMES behind Tom as he leaves. There’s a brief beat of silence before Tony glances up, his smirk growing even wider.  

**TONY**
(Batman voice)
I’m thinking dill pickles.  

Nina throws a dough ball at his head.  

LATER:  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - NIGHT  

Tom walks back in with a small grocery bag in hand. The door CHIMES loudly, catching everyone mid-bickering. Jimmy grabs the bag immediately, grinning like Tom just handed him a bag of gold doubloons.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh hell yes. Let’s make history, boys.  

Becky slumps into her booth dramatically.  

**BECKY**  
This isn’t a restaurant anymore. It’s a crime scene.  

**TONY**  
Relax. Pickles are the future of pizza, Becky. Just wait.  

Becky grabs her soda and throws a crumpled straw wrapper at him.  

**BECKY**  
I hope it’s the future of your funeral.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - KITCHEN - NIGHT  

Tony’s newest creation sits steaming on the counter: *ham-and-American-cheese pizza 2.0, now with pickles.* The room is thick with both tension and disgust as the crew gathers around the horrifying pie like it’s a crime scene. 

Tom leans against the counter, watching this unfold like the commander of a doomed mission who knows shit isn’t ending well.  

Tony slices one piece with calm surgical precision, lifting the slice like he’s presenting a trophy. His voice is steady, cold, and very much *in charge.*  

**TOM**  
Alright. New system. Everyone takes a bite, or they’re fired. No exceptions.  

Jimmy stares at him, blinking.  

**JIMMY**  
Uh… you’re joking, right?  

Tony lets the lack of response hang in the air, his stare sharp enough to pressurize carbon into diamonds.  

**BECKY**  
*(scandalized)*  
You can’t fire us for NOT eating your crusty war crime, Tom! That’s not even—TOM! You can’t do that!  

Tom doesn’t even look up.  

**TOM**  
I mean, I legally can. It’s a private business.  

**BECKY**  
What the FUCK.  

**NINA**  
*(crossing her arms)*  
I’m not eating it. Fire me. Fuck you, I’ll sue.  

Tony smirks faintly, leaning back in his chair.  

**TONY**  
Oh no, you won’t sue. Because then you’d have to admit, in court, that you got fired over refusal to eat pizza. Your lawyer would quit out of humiliation.  

The room groans in unison. Becky buries her face dramatically in her hands.  

**BECKY**  
This pizza’s gonna kill us. It’s gonna kill our careers and our reputations.  

Jimmy takes a bite finds himself borderline aroused. Tony picks up another slice and takes a confident bite.  

**TONY**  
Stop stalling. Grab a slice.  

One by one, the crew reluctantly caves, grabbing slices like survivors accepting their fate. Becky holds hers like it’s radioactive. Jimmy sniffs it cautiously, wincing. Nina won’t even make eye contact with hers, like she’s afraid it might attack.  

Tom grabs his piece without hesitation and takes a bite. He chews, tilting his head slightly.  

**TOM**  
It’s… close. There’s potential.  

**BECKY**  
*(muttering instead of biting)*  
Oh my god. I’m surrounded by psychopaths.  

**TOM**  
But something’s wrong. What’s throwing it off?  
Tony taps his chin thoughtfully, smirking wider.  

**TONY**  
It’s the sauce. The tomato’s getting in the way. Too heavy. Doesn’t balance the brine or the cheese.  

The room collectively stiffens. Nina glares at him.  

**NINA**  
So what are you saying? No sauce?  

**TONY**  
No, no. We need a base. Just not tomato.  

**BECKY**  
*(snapping)*  
It can’t be mayo. I’m drawing the line RIGHT NOW.  

**TOM**  
*(half-joking, but not really)*  
Tony, what about… garlic ranch? Or cream cheese? Or, I dunno, garlic olive oil?  

Tony strokes his chin like an artist inspecting his masterpiece, clearly taking this question *way too seriously.*  

**TONY**  
Garlic ranch would be predictable. Too Midwest for my vibe.  

He pauses, narrowing his eyes, the gears visibly turning in his head.  

**TONY (CONT'D)**  
Cream cheese, though. That could work. Adds richness. Cuts through the pickles.  

**BECKY**  
*(horrified)*  
No! No CREAM CHEESE! That’s like serving pizza on a goddamn bagel!  

Tony raises an eyebrow at her, completely unfazed.  

**TONY**  
Bagels are good. Everybody likes bagels.  

Jimmy groans loudly, slapping a hand over his face.  

**JIMMY**  
*No one’s putting a literal bagel on a pizza, Becky!*  

Tony shrugs, smirking faintly.  

**TONY**  
Not yet.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - NIGHT  

Tom walks in, bag of groceries under one arm, looking like he’s just resigned himself fully to this chaotic existence. The door CHIMES behind him as the crew snaps to attention like kids trying to act innocent after being caught doing something evil.

Tony leans casually against the counter, grinning faintly. Becky groans loudly from the booth, sprawled out like the victim of a dramatic tragedy. Nina tries to look unbothered, but the tension in her dough-kneading is borderline murderous. Jimmy just grabs a fresh slice of ham-and-pickle pizza and grins like the entire situation gives him life.  

**TOM**  
*(lifting the bag)*  
Alright. Garlic, cream cheese, and my last ounce of dignity. Who’s building this?  

Tony raises his hand lightly, like a student proud to answer a question in class.  

**TONY**  
That would be me. Step aside, amateurs.  

Becky sits up violently in her booth, pointing accusingly at the grocery bag.  

**BECKY**  
You actually DID it?! You went out and BOUGHT his... supplies?!  

Tom shrugs, setting the bag on the counter.  

**TOM**  
It’s called facilitating creative breakouts.

**BECKY**  
Facilitating?! You’re helping him turn a pizza into a *science experiment gone wrong!*  

Tony pulls the cream cheese out of the bag, inspecting it like it’s rare treasure.  

**TONY**  
Incorrect. I’m turning pizza into *art.*  

**NINA**  
*(mutters, glaring at him)*  
Art my ass.  

**TONY**
(Quietly)
Your ass is art.

From the corner booth, *Mr. Zen* is casually lounging, leaning back with his arms draped across the seat like he’s in the middle of a photo shoot. He watches the whole interaction unfold, grinning.  

**MR. ZEN**  
Man, you guys really go hard. This place runs on chaos fuel, huh?  

Jimmy spins toward him, waving his pizza slice dramatically.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh, this is normal. If we’re not screaming at each other about pizza toppings, something’s wrong.  

Tony smirks faintly as he spreads the cream cheese onto flattened dough with the precision of a surgeon.  

**TONY**  
I’d describe it more as... high-pressure culinary brainstorming.  

Mr. Zen laughs lightly.  

**MR. ZEN**  
If that’s what you wanna call it.  

Becky leans across her booth, narrowing her eyes at him, clearly sizing him up.  

**BECKY**  
Alright, Zen Man. You’ve been hanging around long enough—you got a real name, or is it actually just “Dave Franco Jr.?”  

The crew freezes slightly, waiting for him to react. To everyone’s surprise, Mr. Zen just shrugs casually, tossing his own slice into a to-go box.  

**MR. ZEN**  
Oh, yeah. It’s Josh.  

Nina’s head snaps up instantly, glaring at him like he’s just insulted her ancestors.  

**NINA**  
What?! All this time you’ve been... JOSH?!  

Josh shrugs again, grinning.  

**JOSH (MR. ZEN)**  
What can I say? Josh is a solid name. Good vibes, real minimalist.  

**BECKY**  
*(groaning)*  
Great. All that self-proclaimed sophistication, and he’s *literally a Josh.* Unbelievable.  

Jimmy sits down next to Josh in the booth, throwing an arm over his shoulder like they’re lifelong pals.  

**JIMMY**  
Oh no, that’s perfect. Josh, bro— 4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444

Josh just laughs lightly, nodding.  

**JOSH**  
I can live with that.  

Meanwhile, Tony slides the newly assembled garlic-and-cream-cheese-pickle pizza into the oven like he’s prepping for a Michelin star review. Becky stares at the oven with pure disdain.  

**BECKY**  
I can’t believe this is happening. We’re Frankenstein-ing pizza before my eyes. Tom, you suck for enabling this.  

**TOM**  
*(deadpan)*  
You’re welcome.  

---

LATER:  

The *new-and-possibly-improved pizza* emerges from the oven, golden and crispy, smelling weirdly... amazing. Tony slices into it with precision, lifting the first slice with a flourish.  

**TONY**  
Alright, grab a piece, critics. Time for redemption.  

Becky stares at the pizza like it just personally insulted her family.  

**BECKY**  
Hell no. Not happening.  

Tony smirks faintly and hands the plate directly to her.  

**TONY**  
Boss’s orders. Remember? Bite or get fired.  

Nina grabs a slice too, glaring at both Tony and Tom like they’ve betrayed her.  

**NINA**  
We’re gonna regret this.  

One after the other, Becky and Nina both take cautious bites, the room frozen as everyone waits for their reaction.  

At first, there’s silence. Then:  

**BECKY**  
...Shit.  

**NINA**  
Ohhhh no.  

Tony leans forward slightly, raising an eyebrow.  

**TONY**  
Tastes amazing, doesn’t it?  

Becky groans loudly, slamming her head against the counter.  

**BECKY**  
I want to HATE it. I WANT TO.  

**NINA**  
*(through gritted teeth)*  
It’s actually good. I hate you.  

Jimmy throws his arms into the air dramatically.  

**JIMMY**  
That’s it! Tony wins. Pizza is dead. Nothing sacred remains.  

Tom just leans back, crossing his arms, looking far too pleased with the outcome.  

**TOM**  
Looks like we’ve got a new special for the menu.  

**BECKY & NINA**  
*(shouting)*  
NO!  

The room erupts into chaos again, filled with overlapping roasts and arguments as Tony calmly takes another slice.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - MAIN FLOOR - LATE NIGHT  

The lights are dim, and the chairs are flipped onto the tables as the closing shift begins winding down. The energy is calmer now, but the echoes of the day’s chaos still hum faintly in the air. Becky has already disappeared from the scene, true to form— leaving zero effort behind. Tony’s long gone too, probably sitting on his balcony with a cigarette and whiskey like the world’s most chaotic enigma.  

At the center of the room, *Josh (aka Mr. Zen)* helps Nina wipe down tables, still cool and collected but with a gentler, more genuine energy now. He’s got a rag in one hand, the red rose he brought her earlier tucked into his back pocket.  

**JOSH (ZEN)**  
You know, I kept thinking this place couldn’t possibly be as dramatic as it seemed. Then I stuck around, and...  
*(grinning)*  
...I get it now. Y’all are wild.  

Nina rolls her eyes, scrubbing down the table closest to her with a little too much force, clearly trying not to let her face betray how much she’s blushing.  

**NINA**  
We’re fine. You’re just complicated.  

Josh leans on the table he’s just finished wiping, shooting her an amused look.  

**JOSH (ZEN)**  
Oh, I’m complicated? That’s rich coming from the girl who looks like she’s about to stab someone with a dough roller half the time.  

Nina glares at him, but there’s no heat behind it.  

**NINA**  
I’m only half as violent as you think I am. On a good day.  

Josh laughs softly, adjusting a chair as he straightens up.  

**JOSH (ZEN)**  
You’re fun, you know that? Like, genuinely fun.  

Nina freezes for half a second, caught off guard, before busying herself with another table.  

**NINA**  
*(muttering)*  
Fun’s overrated.  

Josh smirks, stuffing his rag into his back pocket and stepping closer to her.  

**JOSH (ZEN)**  
Guess I’m a sucker for overrated, then.  

Nina doesn’t respond, but her face says it all: blushing. Embarrassed. Definitely caught off guard.

INT. VHS PIZZA - COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER  

Tom stands by the register, flipping off lights and locking drawers as he gets ready to head upstairs to his apartment. He glances over at Nina and Josh near the door, and then at Jimmy, who’s flipping a soda bottle cap into the air absentmindedly.  

**TOM**  
Alright, I’m clocking out. Goodnight

**JIMMY**  
*(grinning)*  
G'night!

Tom shakes his head, pocketing his keys as he heads toward the stairs.  

**TOM**  
See you clowns tomorrow.  

He disappears up the stairs, leaving the rest of the crew to finish the night on their own.

EXT. VHS PIZZA - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT  

Nina walks Josh to the door, flipping the lock behind him as he steps out onto the dark sidewalk. The sounds of quiet city life echo faintly in the background—a car engine, distant laughter, the occasional honk.  

Josh turns back to her with that same easygoing smile, holding his hands in his pockets.  

**JOSH (ZEN)**  
Goodnight, Nina. Have fun dreaming about geometry and pizza.  

Nina rolls her eyes, but she’s smiling now— even if it’s small and hesitant.  

**NINA**  
Goodnight, Josh.  

He waves casually and heads off into the night, his steps echoing down the sidewalk. Nina watches him go for a moment, then exhales sharply—half relief, half exasperation—before turning and heading back inside.  

INT. VHS PIZZA - MAIN FLOOR - 11PM  

Nina finishes locking the front door and looks around the room, frowning slightly when she realizes Jimmy’s still there, leaning against the counter.  

**NINA**  
Why are you still here?  

**JIMMY**  
*(shrugs)*  
Figured I’d give you a ride home. You don’t have to walk or whatever. Unless you’re into the whole streetlight murder vibe.  

**NINA**  
*(suspicious)*  
Why do you care?  

Jimmy tosses the soda cap in the air again, catching it without looking.  

**JIMMY**  
C’mon, don’t make it weird. Let’s go.  

Nina huffs softly, but she grabs her jacket anyway.  

**NINA**  
Fine. Whatever. But if you fart in the car, I'm walking.  

*They both exit the restaurant.*
